cd [projectRoot]/public/sample
grunt server

cd [projectRoot]/public/sample/app
bower search [keyword you want]

* access between server-client with json
* use multiple schema with DB migration(evolution)
* upload to aws-S3
* use mock test with `implicit parameter`
* use cookie for session-management
